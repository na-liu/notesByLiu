# Jessica'sClassReunion

Jessica is 35 years old.

She  graduated from middle school 20 years ago. 

This year, her middle school class **had its 20-year** class reunion.

All of her classmates and teachers were invited to attend.

It was going to be at a hotel **near where** their school used to be.

Like many other buildings,their school had been **torn down**.

At first she **wasn't sure if** she could go to the reunion.

One reason was that there wasn't anyone in particular that she wanted to see.

Another reason was that she was very busy.

She was a working mother, with a boy 8 years old and her husband who was rarely at home.

Going to the the reunion **meant** that she ~~will~~ wolud have to **arrange for aomeone** to take care of things while she was away.她必须安排一个人在他不在的时候照看东西。

That woludn't be easy.

She didn't want to take her boy to the party, and her husband ....

Then she got a message from Sharon, one of her old classmates.

Sharon was contacting people from their class and urging everyone to come.

In their  school days, Sharon was class monitor,and now she was helping to organized the reunion.

They exchanged messages, and Jessica said she couldn't make it.

Then they gave her call and they talked for almost an hour.

Sharon really wanted her to come,and so dis a couple od Jessica's old friends.

They were all wondering how she was doing.

None of them had seen or heared from her since graduation.

They were especially curious since she hadn't gone to their first reunion 10 years before.



He agreed to do it beacuse her mother had offered to come and stay for a while so Jessica could attend to reunion.

Since he and her mother didn't get alone, he decided to chage his schedule and work from home for a few days.

He really didn't want her mother to come, though he didn't say so.

Once she got to the reunion ,she was shocked.

Everyone has aged so much and many were out of shape.

Some who used to be good-looking had lost their looks completely and others looked much better than before.

It was strange how time had changed people in such different ways.

Anyway, she decided that since she was there, she would try to enjoy it.
