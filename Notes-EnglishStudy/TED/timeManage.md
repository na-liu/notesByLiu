​    How to Manage Your Free Time

​      When people fĩnd out I write about time management, They assume two things. One is thatI'm always on time, and Im not. I have four small children, and I would like to blame them for myocaional tardiness, but sometimes it's just not their fault. I was once late to my own speech ontime management. We all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony. The secondthing they assume is that I have 1ots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there.Sometimes I'l1 hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines, generally on how tohelp their readers find an extra hour in the day. And the idea is that we'll shave bits of time offeveryday acivities, add it up, and we'll have time for the good stf.. I question the entire premiseof this piee, but Im always inrested in hearing what they've come up with before they call me.Some of my favrite: doing errans where you only have to make right hand BBeing

​      extremely judicious in microwave usage: it says three to three -and-a-half minutes on the package,we're totally getting in on the bottom side of that. And my personal favorite, which makes senseon some level, is to DVR your favorite shows so you can fast-forward through the commercials.That way, you save eight minutes every half hour, so in the course of two hours of watching TV,you find 32 minutes to exercise.

​      Which is true.

​      You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise? Don't watch two hours of TV a day,right? Anyway, the idea is we'll, save bits of time here and there, add it up, we wil fnally get toeverything we want to do. But after studying how successful people spend their time and lookingat their schedules hour by hour, I think this idea has it completely backward. We don't build the

lives we want by saving time. We build the lives we want, and then time saves itself. Here's whatImean. I recently did a time diary project looking at 1,001 days in the 1ives of extremely busywomen. They had demanding jobs, sometimes their own buinesses kids to care for, maybeparents to care for. community commitments. busy, busy people.

​      I had them keep track of their time for a week, so I could add up how much they worked andslept, and I intrvieved them about their stratgies, for my book. One of the women whose timelog I studied. .she goes out on a Wednesday night for something. She comes home to fĩnd that herwater heater has broken, and there is now water all over her basement. If you've ever had anythinglike this happen to you, you know it is a hugely damaging, frightening, sopping mess. So she'sdealing with the immediate afermath that night, next day she's got plumbers coming in, day afterthat, prossional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet. All this is being recorded on hertime log. Winds up taking seven hours of her week. Seven hous.

​      That's like finding an extra hour in the day.

​      But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week, "Could you find seven hours totrain. for a triatlon?"

​      "Could you dind seven hours to mentor seven worthy people?" I'm sure she would've said

what most of us would've said, which is, "No.. .can't you see how busy I am?" Yet when she had tofnd seven hours because there is water all over her basement, she found seven hours. And whatthis shows us is that time is highly elasic. We cannot make more time, but time will streth toaccommodate what we choose to put into it.

​      And so the key to time management is treating our prorities as the equivalent of that brokenwater heater. To get at this, Ilike to use language from one of the busiest people I ever

[inerviewe.By](qq://txfile/#) busy,I mean she was runing a small business with 12 people on the paorol,shehad six chidren in her spare time. I was geting in touch wih her to set up an inerview on howshe "had it all". .that phrase.I remember it was a Thursday morning. and she was not available tospeak with me. Of course right?

​      But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me is that she was out for a hike,because itwas a beautiful spring moming. and she wanted to go for a hike. So of course this makes me evenmore intrigued,and when I finally do catch up with her,she explains it like this.She says,"ListenLaura,everything I do,every minute I spend,is my choice."And rather than say,"I don't have timeto do_x,y or z"she'd say,"I don't do x,y or z because its not a priryỵ."I" don't have time"ftenmeans"Ilts not a priryt."f you think about i,tats really more accrate language.

​      I could tell you I don't have time to dust to dust my blinds,but that's not true.If you offered topay me $10000 to dust my blinds,I would get to it pretty quickly.Since that is not going tohappenI can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking timeits that I don't want to do itUingthis language reminds us that time is a choice. And graned,there may be horible consequences formaking difent choices,I will give you that But we are smart people. and cetainly over the 1ongrun,we have. the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be. [there.So](qq://txfile/#) how do we dothat?How do we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater?

​      ell,frst we need to figure out what they are.I want to give you two strategies for thinkingabout this The frs,on the pofessionan side:'m sure many people coming up to the end of the yearare giving or getting annual performance reviews.You 1ook back over your successes over the

year,your "opportunities for growth."And this serves its purpose,but I find it's more efecetive to dothis 1ooing [forward.So](qq://txfile/#) I want you to pretend it's the end of next year. You're giving yourself aperformance review (XiF1) ,and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you

proressinallyWrite next year's review:What 3-5 things would make it a great year for you

[presisally.So](qq://txfile/#) you can write next year's performance review now.And you can do this for yourpersonal life,too.

​      I'm sure many of you,like me,come December.get cards that contain these folded up sheetsof colored paper,on which written what is known as the family holiday Iettr.eit. of a wretchedgenre of litretrarelygoig on about how amazing everyone in the household is,or even morescitlligtiogwn busy everyone in the household is.But these lett serve a purpose,which is thatthey tell your fiends and family what you did tin your personal life that matered to you over [theyear.So](qq://txfile/#) this year's kind of done,but I want you to pretend it's the end of next year,and it has beeran absolutely amazing year for you and the people you care about.Write the family hollday

lete:.What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?So you can write next yea'sfamily holiday letter now.Don't send it.lese,don't send it.

​      But you can write it.

​      And now,between the. performance review and the family holiday 1ettr,wree have a 1ist of sixto ten goals we can work on in the next yea.And now we need to break these down into [doablestps.So](qq://txfile/#) maybe you want to write a family hitoryFirstyou can read some other family

​      histories,get a sense for the style.Then maybe think about the questions you want to ask yourrelatives,set up appointments to interview them.Or maybe you want to run a [5K.So](qq://txfile/#) you need tofind a race and sign up.fñgure out a traning plan,and dig those shoes out of the back of thecose.And then. this is key..we treat our prorties as the equivalent of that broken waterheter,by puting them into our schedules first.

​      We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them,I find a realy good time todo this is Friday afernoons Friday aftermoon is what an economist might call a "low oppotunitycot" time.Most ofus are not sitig there on Friday afemoons saing."I am excited to makeprogress toward my personal and prosinal prorties right now. 'But we are willil to thinkabout what those should be. So take a litl bit of time Friday afenoon make yourself athree -category priority 1is:career relationships. self.Making a three -category 1ist reminds us thatthere should be something in all three categories. Career,we think aboutrelationships,self not somu

​      But anyway,just a short lis,two to three items in each.Then look out over the whole of the

next week,and see where you can plan them in.Where you plan them in is up to you.I know this isgoing to be more complicated for some people than others.

​      I mean,some people's 1ives are just harder than [others.It](qq://txfile/#) is not going to be easy to find timeto take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own.I get [that.An](qq://txfile/#)đ I don'twant to minimize anyone's suguge.But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you areempoweringThere are 168 hours in a wek.lwenty-four times seven is 168 hous.Thatisalot oftime.If you are working a fulill job,so 40 hours a week, sleping eight hours a night,so 56 hoursa week.. that leaves 72 hours for other things.

​      That is a 1ot of time.You say you're working 50 hours a week, maybe a main job and a sidehustle: Wel,ltat leaves 62 hours for other things. You say you're working 60 hours. Well that leaves52 hours for other things. You say you're working more than 60 hours Well are you sure?Therewas once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks with time diaries.They found thatpeople claiming 75-plus-hour work weeks were off by about 25 hours.You can guess in whichdiretion,right?Anyway,in 168 hours a week,I think we can find time for what matters to you.Ifyou want to spend more time with your kids,you want to study more for a test you're taking,youwant to exercise for three hours and volnere for two,you can. And that's even if youre workingway more than fulltimte hours.

​      So we have plenty of time,which is great,because guess what?

​      We don't even need that much time to do amazing things.But when most of us have bits oftime,what do we do?Pull out the phone right?Start deleting emails .Otherwise,we're puttering

around the house or watching TV.But small moments can have great power. You can use your bitsof time for bits of joy.Maybe. it's choosing to read something wonderfu1 onthe bus on the way to .workI know when I had a job that required two bus rides and a subway ride every moning,I usedto go to the library on weekens to get stuf to read. It made the whole experience almost, almost,enjoyable.

​      Breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying If family dinner is out because of yourcrazy work schedule, maybe. family breakfat could be a good subtiutets about loking at thewhole of one's time and seeing where the good stuff can go.

​      I truly believe thi,there is time.Even if we are busy,we have time for what matters Andwhen we focus on what matters,we can build the lives we want in the time we've got.
